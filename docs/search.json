    "text": "Introduction\nHello everyone, hope you all are doing well . I am currently working on my master’s degree in data analytics engineering. I’ve recently graduated in May majoring in computer science and business systems from VNRVJIET, Hyderabad, India . I intend to learn data mining, data ethics, visualisation techniques and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure through data analytics course so that I can build my portfolio showcasing my work based on data analytics and working on real world problems and projects. During my undergraduate studies, I learned programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and R. I also completed projects including developing a chatbot for healthcare services for diabetics and creating an automated human recognition system. I have even volunteered for my university cultural and technical fests. I’d like to describe myself into 3 adjectives, friendly, positive thinker and enthusiast."
